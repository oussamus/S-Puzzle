Goals:
Implement a solution for the S-Puzzle board using the following 3 search algorithms:
1. depth-first.
2. iterative-deepening.
3. Algorithm A*.
to complete S-puzzles

The first file called assignment2 containing the depth-first and iterative-deepening algorithmes, Make sure you comment out one of the function at the end to run the code.
The second is for the algorithm A, you can just put value in the init to run the code.
